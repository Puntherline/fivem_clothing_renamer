# What it is and what it does
A batch script that will automate renaming clothing items so you don't have to do that anymore.

# How to use it
You need to have a properly formatted "stream" folder.

Example:
```
your_resource/
├── fxmanifest.lua
└── stream/
    ├── mp_f_freemode_01/
    │   ├── accs_007_u.ydd
    │   ├── feet_012_u.ydd
    │   └── hair_008_u.ydd
    ├── mp_m_freemode_01/
    │   └── hair_004_u.ydd
    └── mp_m_freemode_01_mp_m_christmas2018/
        ├── berd_000_u.ydd
        └── berd_011_u.ydd
```

Then just drag and drop the "stream" folder onto the batch file and follow the instructions on screen.
